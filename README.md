Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrency

Scrooge coin program implements the UTXO model, the logic to process
transactions and produce the ledger. Scrooge organizes transactions into time
periods or blocks. In each block, Scrooge receives a list of transactions,
validates them, and publishes a list of validated transactions
(similar structure to Bitcoin transactions).
